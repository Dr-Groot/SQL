# SYNTAX
---
A database most often contains one or more tables. Each table is identified by a name (e.g. "Customers" or "Orders"). 
Tables contain records (rows) with data.

## SQL STATEMENTS
---
With the help of SQL statements or query we are able to perform actions on database.
For example, if you want to select all the record of a table:

```sql
SELECT * FROM TABLE_NAME;
```
> Above statement will allow all the element of the table to be displayed as * means all columns 
---
SQL keyword are not Case Sensitive, which means
```sql
select = SELECT
```
---
> Why semicolons in the end of the Query?

Semicolon is the standard way to separate each SQL statement in database systems that allow more than one SQL statement
to be executed in the same call to the server.
